# Mongoid Occurrence Views

Use [Mongodb views](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/views) for querying events with multiple occurrences.

A list of occurrences (embedded in a Mongoid Document, each defined by datetime from & datetime to) is expanded (typically on save) into a list of daily occurrences. Two aggregations project the events into Mongodb views (3.4+) that can be subsequently queried – both for the original, or the expanded occurrences.


## Installation

```ruby
gem 'mongoid_occurrence_views'
